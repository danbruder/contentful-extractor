# Contentful Extractor

I had blog content on contentful and wanted to move to markdown stored in github. This script pulls the blog posts out of the contenful export json payload and saves them as markdown files.

This is a throwaway script so its not tidy by any means, but I'm publishing in case it would be a helpful example to someone.
